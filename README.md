# inventory-system
This is a JavaFx based solution that allows Administrator to manage the inventory of an online E-commerce platform



## Setting up environment

Make sure that you add the below code snippet in the VM arguements when attempting to run the application

``` java
--module-path "C:\javafx\javafx-sdk-17.0.6\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
```

Also ensure that you have set up a `User Library` for `Java FX`. When you clone the repo you will need to configure the `build path` such that you add the `Java FX class library`
